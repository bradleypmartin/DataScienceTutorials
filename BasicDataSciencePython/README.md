# BasicDataSciencePython
This repo contains a couple short examples of data science code written up in Python during udemy.com introductory coursework
on the subject.  There's some quantitative analysis of stock prices for automakers Ford, GM, and Tesla completed as a capstone project during the Python for Finance and Trading Algorithms course led by Jose Portilla. There's also some shorter instances of work completed that covers various "hot" data science topics (machine learning; basic neural network stuff) during the Data Science, Deep Learning & Machine Learning with Python course taught by Frank Kane.

I took both of these courses in early 2018.
